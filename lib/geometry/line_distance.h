name = "Line Distance"
[info]
description = "Returns the signed distance between point `p` and the line containing points `a` and `b`. Positive value on left side and negative on right as seen from `a` towards `b`. `a == b` gives `nan`. `P` is supposed to be `Point<T>` or `Point3D<T>` where `T` is e.g. `double` or `ll`. It uses products in intermediate steps so watch out for overflow if using `int` or `ll`. Using `Point3D` will always give a non-negative distance. For `Point3D`, call `.dist` on the result of the cross product."
